            <h1>Sanctions applied by the European Commission to American companies</h1>

            <p>
            	During 2008-2019, the European Commission blamed several American companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Qualcomm and Apple for violation of the Competition Act and imposed significant fines. The total amount of fees is more than 10 billion euros. It should be noted that the decisions to apply fines were made directly by the European Commission. No court took part in making this decision.
            </p>

            <p>
The sanctions may be proven illegal in relation to the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law (Public law 91-452). The European Commission has violated legal doctrines and is corrupt body. 
Such conclusion was made as the result of our investigation of a case of corruption (more specifically of Schengen visa trafficking) which was held from 2012 to 2019. Our dossier consists of more than 1000 pages.
            </p>

            <p>
Based on our dossier, the sanctions of the European Commission can be challenged in an American court.<br/>
It should be noted that sanctions caused damage to the interests of thousands American shareholders. Besides that, the budget of the USA did not receive significant income as taxes.           	
            </p>
			
            <h2>General information about the offenses committed by the European Commission, or in which the European Commission may be involved.</h2>

            <p>
1.<br/>
The most obvious evidence published at <a href="http://www.justiceforall.eu/traffic">www.justiceforall.eu/traffic</a>. In its report to the European Parliament, the European Commission states that the question of the crime which is the basis of the Schengen visas traffic was not raised nor discussed. 
But here we also publish the previous letters of the Commission where the problem of the Schengen visas traffic is being discussed. 
We can see that in its report, the European Commission replaced the main subject from “Schengen visas traffic” to “national visas traffic” (problems with emission of national visas are within the competence of national European governments). This deliberate substitution, which can be defined as falsification, allowed the Commission to make a statement that the EU authorities are not competent in the matter. This way, by cheating the Parliament, which is a body competent to control the Commission, the Commission avoided investigation of the crime which involves representatives of the high-level European authorities.
            </p>

            <p>
This example allows us to make a comparison of the behavior of the European Commission in case of violation of two different laws of the European Union: the EU Competition Act and the Community Code on Visas (Regulation (EC) 810/2009 which governs emission of Schengen visas). The Commission is responsible for supervision of execution of both these EU laws.
            </p>

            <p>
The European Commission blamed several American companies for violation of the Competition Act and imposed significant fines. Obviously, the Commission seeks to receive excess income in the EU budget.<br/>
In another case related to the Community Code on Visas, the European Commission in its letters acknowledged that there were cases of violation of this law, but refused to conduct an investigation. Moreover, the Commission itself committed a violation (falsification of the report presented to the European Parliament) to hide a serious crime, the Schengen visa traffic. According to our information, this illegal business is still flourishing in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia and brings tens of millions euros per year to its organizers. There are representatives of the EU authorities and individuals close to them among the organizers of the Schengen visa traffic. The information was obtained during our own investigation held in 2012-2015, as well as during contacts with the European Commission in 2015-2019. 
            </p>

            <p>
This example proves that the European Commission is a corrupt body and practices selective justice. It means that the European Commission has violated legal doctrines. 
This way, the activities of the European Commission are subject to the RICO law.
            </p>

            <p>
2.<br/>
For the first time, a major scandal in connection with Schengen visas traffic occurred in Europe in 2011. Then the police of four EU countries - Germany, France, Denmark and Spain - got on the trail of the organizers of Schengen visas traffic. In this case, the European Commission did not take steps to investigate the crime and bring the participants to justice. As a result, since 2012, Schengen visas traffic has spread to new countries and began to bring even more revenue to its organizers. 
            </p>


            <p>
3.<br/>
In December 2014, a witness was killed near Warsaw, Poland who could point to the organizers of Schengen visas traffic (the murder is mentioned in the report of the Commission presented to the European Parliament). The European Commission shares the responsibility for this murder.
            </p>

            <p>
4.<br/>
There has been psychological and physical pressure exerted on the participants of the Schengen visas traffic investigation aimed to intimidate and force to abandon the attempts to make this crime public. Acts of intimidation take place even in Brussels. The Belgian Federal Police and Crown Prosecutor are not taking any measures to investigate or stop the acts of intimidation. Probable reason for the inaction of the Belgian authorities is the influence of the European Commission.
            </p>

            <p>
5.<br/>
In 2015, the Belgian Federal Police opened the case No BR.20.LL.132178/2015 about Schengen visas traffic. The investigator said the case would be forwarded to Europol for investigation. In fact, the case has never been forwarded to Europol and the investigation of Schengen visas traffic was not continued. The most likely reason for this is the influence of the European Commission on the Belgian police.
            </p>

            <p>
6.<br/>
In 2016, the French Juridical Police sent our information about Schengen visas traffic to Europol. In order to maintain contact with Europol, I sent a letter to the Director of Europol, informing about the change of my address. The representative of Europol signed the documents of Belgian and Dutch post confirming the delivery of my letter. Later it turned out that the signature shown on the Holland Post website (where Europol is located) differs from the signature on the Belgian Post document, which was delivered to me in Brussels. Different signatures prove that falsification of the delivery confirmation took place. Obviously my letter has not been delivered to Europol. This example shows that the criminals manipulate mail correspondence. There also were other cases of manipulation of postal communications. In some cases registered letters were not delivered to their addressees and just disappeared.
			</p>

			<p>
7.<br/>
There also were cases of illegal manipulation of our side’s electronic and telephone communications, as well as bank cards. 
			</p>

			<p>
8.<br/>
In Brussels, the lawyers of the law firms “Louis European Law” and “Deprevernet”, to which we had appealed to initiate a legal process against the European Commission, were probably bribed. At first, both firms agreed to represent our side. However, they refused to do so later. As “Deprevernet” explained in its letter, the refusal was due to a conflict of interest. This means that these firms had been hired by the European Commission, which manages a huge budget and can offer high fees to the lawyers. In this situation, the European Commission acted illegally.

			</p>

			<p>
The description of the illegal activities of the Commission is not limited to the listed examples. “Justice for all in Europe” ASBL owns the rights to the dossier containing detailed information, documents and other proofs on all of the cases of corruption mentioned above and others. This dossier consists of more than 1000 pages of documents and will be presented in court during the lawsuit against the European Commission. 
			</p>

			<p>
It's important to note that in some cases companies tried unsuccessfully to challenge the fines of the European Commission in the Court of Justice of the European Union. According to the official information of the EU, the activities of the Court are funded from the EU budget, and fines for violations of the EU Competition Act are listed as one of the sources of the EU budget (please see <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/budg_system/financing/fin_en.cfm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/budg_system/financing/fin_en.cfm</a>
Here is a quote:<br/>
 «How is the budget financed? ...<br/>
- Other revenue ...<br/>
- fines on companies for breaching competition laws, etc.»)

			</p>

			<p>
This way, the EU Court of Justice depends on these fines. This circumstance casts doubt on the independence of the Court. 
In addition, we unsuccessfully tried to initiate proceedings against the European Commission in connection with Schengen visas traffic in this court. We have obtained evidence that this court is blocking attempts of legal attack against the EU authorities. In fact, this court is under the control of the European Commission.<br/>
So the only way to challenge the sanctions of the European Commission and get a fair decision is the American court.
